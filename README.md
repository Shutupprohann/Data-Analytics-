### Annual Sales Analysis

This project involved analyzing a retail dataset containing over 1,000 entries to uncover key trends and insights. Using Microsoft Excel, I created a dashboard with Pivot Tables and interactive charts to visualize monthly revenue, state-wise performance, and customer demographics.

• Cleaned and structured a retail dataset comprising order IDs, customer demographics, channels, and revenue data to
enable trend identification.
• Analyzed sales performance by channel (Amazon, Myntra, Ajio), age group, and region using Excel formulas and pivot
tables.
• Created dashboards to visualize monthly orders, state-wise performance, and annual sales trends.
• Identified customer patterns (e.g.top-performing States, age-wise buying behavior) to support strategic decisions
