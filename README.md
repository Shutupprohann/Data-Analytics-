### Annual Sales Analysis

This project involved analyzing a retail dataset containing over 1,000 entries to uncover key trends and insights. Using Microsoft Excel, I created a dashboard with Pivot Tables and interactive charts to visualize monthly revenue, state-wise performance, and customer demographics.

Key contributions:

- Explored sales patterns across different states and identified that more than 65% of total sales originated from the top three regions  
- Used functions like IF and VLOOKUP to segment customer data and classify them based on age and purchase behavior  
- Designed a user-friendly summary report that helps decision-makers understand business performance at a glance  
- Enhanced the dataset with data cleaning and formatting to ensure consistency and accuracy throughout the analysis
